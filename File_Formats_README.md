# Point Cloud File Formats -work in progress
Handeling huge point clouds requires a spatial data structure to efficiatly access each point.
There is a multitude of File Formats that can be used with LAS and LAZ files. A summary of [File Formats](http://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php?title=FILE_I/O), out of which we would focus on: 

* [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

* PCD - the Point Cloud Library format [(PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/), python binding [NLeSc/python-pcl](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-pcl)

* PLY - Polygon File Format or the [Stanford Triangle Format](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep) 

* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - [NLeSc loader and quierier](https://github.com/NLeSC/pointcloud-benchmark/blob/master/python/pointcloud)


## PCD:
The [PCD](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php) file format is used as a file format to support 3D point cloud data. Please refer to [pointclouds.org](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.php) for moe information and reference.
Each PCD file contains a header (ASCII) that identifies and declares certain properties of the point cloud data stored in the file. 
HEADER: The header entries must be specified precisely in the above order, that is:
> VERSION

> FIELDS -  name of each dimension/field that a point can have, for example:
>* FIELDS x y z                                # XYZ 
>* FIELDS x y z rgb                            # XYZ + colors
>* FIELDS x y z normal_x normal_y normal_z     # XYZ + surface normals
>* FIELDS j1 j2 j3                             # moment invariantsâ€¦
>* FIELDS 				                                 # ...

> SIZE - size of each dimension in bytes

> TYPE - type of each dimension as a char.
>  *  I - represents signed types int8 (char), int16 (short), and int32 (int)
>  *  U - represents unsigned types uint8 (unsigned char), uint16 (unsigned short), uint3(unsigned int)
>   * F - represents float types

> COUNT - specifies how many elements does each dimension have. For example, x data usually has 1 element, but a feature descriptor like the VFH has 308. Basically this is a way to introduce n-D histogram descriptors at each point, and treating them as a single contiguous block of memory. Default: count=1.
